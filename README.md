My life's first PHP project
This project had been developed for the company i worked for , the name was Gradient IT solution . i worked there for 8 months. 
the CEO of the IT solution was one of my versity senior brother. He started up a new company and hired me along with my another 2 friends . 

I started working there in 2015 february , 

so the basically this system was , they had a E-COMMERCE . but i did not have any accounce system in backedin . so i had to make the account system for the 
E-commerce 


. Oke the interesting part of this project . i knew nothing about programming and all other stuffs that a software developer required to know 
. but i dared and started making it . and finally i did it. i had been able to make it . then may be , i thought it was becoming a burdan for me 
to work for company . then i quit . 
i did not work there after that
